## Caeser Cipher

Julius Caesar protected his confidential information by encrypting
it using a cipher. Caesar's cipher shifts each letter by a number of
letters. If the shift takes you past the end of the alphabet, just
rotate back to the front of the alphabet. In the case of a rotation by
3,w,x,yand z would map to z, a, v, and c

    Original alphabet: abcdefghijklmnopgrstuvwxy:
    Alphabet rotated +3: defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc


Example
s = There’s-a-starman-waiting-in-the-sky

k=3

The alphabet is rotated by 3, matching the mapping above. The
encrypted string is

Wkhuh’v-d-vwdupdq-zdlwlqj-1lq-wkh-vnb.

Note: The cipher only encrypts letters; symbols, such as -, remain
unencrypted.
